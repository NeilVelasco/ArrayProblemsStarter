# ArrayProblemsStarter
This is the starter files for the Array problems.

The problems are as follows:
1. Given an unsorted array, find the median. (`median(array A)`)

2. Remove duplicates from an unsorted array. (`remove_duplicates(array A)`)

3. Find the indices of the first and last occurrences of a given element in a sorted array. (`first_last(array A)`)

Have your code be evaluated, and checked. If the code passed all tests, then you have successfully done the problems.
